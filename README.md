# Minecraft texture pack maker ![Logo](https://github.com/Leone25/Minecraft-texture-pack-maker/blob/master/minecraft%20texture%20pack%20maker/logo%2068x68.png)

This project is menth to be an open suorce minecraft texture pack creator.

## To do list
My plan is to implement this functions in pretty much this order:
1. Implement a basic gui tant allow the end user to select the block/item/other texture to modify and open such texture in an online editor to modify it
2. Implement a basic pixel art editor( with simple pen, line, gradient line, quare, grandient square, circle, gradient circle, fill, gradient fill, random fill) wich is able to open and modify images from a pre defined set coming from minecraft directly.
3. Implement a user system that allows everyone to create an account on the service (of coulrse it apply to only the single server, password aren shared between various instances, so if a use is hosting the editor by it self he will be able to disable such function)
4. Implement a multy project enviroment, to be able to work on different project at the same time
5. Implement a grup working enviroment, to let multiple users work on the same project at the same time, and maybe even the same element live, but that would require some advance server envioment so it migth come later

## What is already done
Rigth now done is very litle, we got a logo, an a super simple node js http server, and just a blank page.
We already choose a color pallet, plannig to make the editor dark mode only, but it can be changed if anyone has some suggestion to improve you can find the pallet that we are using here( https://github.com/Leone25/Minecraft-texture-pack-maker/blob/master/minecraft%20texture%20pack%20maker/ds-darksites-11c.jpg got that form anther site).
